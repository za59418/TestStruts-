    // rest part will be changed into camel case and that becomes
    // the action and hence the action name is n

    //Moreover just for the sake of remembrance, if we use annotations
    // then we have to specify a init-param for the FilterDispatcher
    // i.e. struts2 filter, named actionPackages, whose
    //value is the name of the packages that will be scanned for containing
    //annotations.

    //Moreover, struts2.2.3 core libraries doesn't contain the annotations
    //facility, it is contained with the convetion-plugin-2.2.3.jar


    //Moreover, this class is contained with actions package, so by default
    //the package for struts.xml url mapping becomes /actions
    //Although it can also be directly referenced, as we already know
    //it is specified in the servlets specification.
